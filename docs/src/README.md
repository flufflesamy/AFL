## What is AFL?

AFL - Selkie Medical Mod (AFL) is an Arma 3 addon that aims to add medical functionality to ACE and KAM medical systems,
with the aim to enhance and fix both addons.

This mod was created for the Selkie Platoon, a Halo ODST Arma 3 unit, however it does not have any dependencies on OPTRE
or unit specific mods.
