## What is AFL?

AFL - Selkie Medical Mod (AFL) is an Arma 3 mod that aims to add medical functionality to ACE and KAM medical systems,
with the aim to enhance and fix both mods.

This mod was created for the [Selkie Platoon](https://units.arma3.com/unit/selkie), an OPTRE Arma 3 unit.
However, it does not have any dependencies on OPTRE or any unit-specific mods and therefore can be used by anyone.
