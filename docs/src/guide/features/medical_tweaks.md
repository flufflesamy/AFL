# Medical Tweaks

AFL modifies the behavior of ACE Medical and KAT Advanced Medical. Currently contains the following features:

<!-- toc -->

## Dressing Vacuum Enhancements

The dressing vacuum (NPWT) has always been broken in KAM.

### Tweaks

### Fixes

Dressing vacuum now bandages and stitches wounds fully. Furthermore, it returns the medic back to the medical menu on completion.

## Neck Tourniquets

Whereas the original neck tourniquet feature was an April Fools joke by the KAM developers[^1], AFL turns this joke feature
into a real feature.

Medics can apply a tourniquet to a patient's neck. This stops bleeding, but stops breathing, causes pain,
increases then decreases heart rate, and eventually causes cardiac arrest.

## IV Enhancements

### Bag Type Display

### Clog Chance

### Viscosity Based Flow Rate
