# Medical Tweaks

AFL modifies the behavior of ACE Medical and KAT Advanced Medical. This page lists some of the important tweaks and fixes.

## Dressing Vacuum (NPWT)

The dressing vacuum (NPWT) has always been broken in KAM.

The NPWT now bandages and stitches wounds fully. Furthermore, it returns the medic back to the medical menu
on completion.

AFL also tweaks the behavior of the NPWT. The NPWT now can be used on bruises and body part trauma, not just when
there are open or bandaged wounds.

## Neck Tourniquets

Whereas the original neck tourniquet feature was an April Fools joke by the KAM developers[^1], AFL turns this joke feature
into a real feature.

Medics can now apply a tourniquet to a patient's neck. This stops bleeding, but stops breathing, causes pain,
increases then decreases heart rate, and eventually causes cardiac arrest.

## IV Enhancements

### Bag Type Display

### Clog Chance

### Viscosity Based Flow Rate
