Once subscribed to, the mod will begin downloading automatically.

### Updating

Steam Workshop mods are managed by the Steam client and should update automatically.

```admonish note
Sometimes, Steam Workshop mods fail to update automatically. If so, force the mod to update by going to the "Mods" category
in the Arma 3 launcher, expanding the "AFL - Selkie Medical Mod" entry, opening the "..." menu,
and clicking on the "Verify" option.

## GitHub

If you wish to use a specific version of AFL (i.e. do not wish to have automatic updates) or you do not want to use
the Steam Workshop for managing your mods, you can download and install AFL manually on GitHub.

### Downloading

Each AFL release can be downloaded on the [Releases Page on GitHub](https://github.com/flufflesamy/AFL/releases/latest).

Once downloaded, extract the archive (e.g. `[txt] AFL_v0.6.8.zip`) file into your directory of choice.
The mod can then be added as a local mod via the Arma 3 launcher.

### Updating

To update a mod that is installed manually, download a new version from GitHub and replace the files you
installed on your file system.

## Loading AFL

Once installed, AFL can be loaded in the Arma 3 Launcher. To load a mod, navigate to the "Mods" section in the launcher.
Then, find AFL in the list of installed mods and click the check mark on the right to load it.
